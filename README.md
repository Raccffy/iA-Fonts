If you fork or use these fonts, reference iA Writer clearly.

## Fork

This fork fixes known iA Writer's typeface issues such as [omitted "monospaced" proportion info](https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts/issues/73), [Quattro's font incorrect weight info](https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts/issues/78) and Windows Font Viewer's rendering issues.

Fonts were imported, corrected and then generated using [FontForge](https://fontforge.org). Only metadata was corrected with the exception of "iA Writer Mono S" typeface.
